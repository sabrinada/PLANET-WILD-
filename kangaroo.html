        <h1>Kangaroo</h1>
        <p>The kangaroo is one of Australia's most iconic animals, known for its powerful hind legs and large tail, which helps it maintain balance while hopping. Kangaroos are marsupials, meaning they carry and nurse their young in a pouch. They are an essential part of Australia’s ecosystems, serving as grazers that help maintain the balance of vegetation.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Kangaroos are characterized by their long, strong hind legs that allow them to cover large distances by hopping. Their large, muscular tail is used for balance, and they have a small head with large ears. They have a pouch where females carry their joeys until they are old enough to survive outside the pouch. Kangaroos range in size depending on the species, but the red kangaroo is the largest, reaching up to 8 feet in length, including the tail.</p>

        <h2>Habitat and Diet</h2>
        <p>Kangaroos are found in a wide range of habitats across Australia, including forests, grasslands, and deserts. They are herbivores, primarily grazing on grasses and shrubs. Kangaroos have adapted to Australia’s dry environment and can survive on very little water by obtaining most of their moisture from the plants they eat.</p>

        <h2>Conservation Status</h2>
        <p>While kangaroos are not currently considered endangered, they face threats from habitat destruction, climate change, and hunting. In some areas, they are considered pests due to their numbers and the competition they create with livestock. Conservation efforts focus on habitat preservation, managing kangaroo populations, and mitigating human-wildlife conflict.</p>

        <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
        <p>You can help kangaroos by supporting conservation organizations that focus on habitat preservation, advocating for responsible wildlife management policies, and reducing human-wildlife conflict. It’s also important to spread awareness about the importance of maintaining balance in ecosystems and protecting the natural habitats of Australia’s wildlife.</p>
