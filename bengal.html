        <h1>Bengal Tiger</h1>
        <p>The Bengal tiger is one of the most iconic and majestic predators in the world.

        <h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>
        <p>Bengal tigers are known for their powerful build, with adult males weighing between 400 and 500 pounds. They have a unique coat pattern of orange and black stripes, each tiger's pattern being as unique as a human fingerprint. Their large paws and muscular bodies make them formidable hunters, capable of taking down prey much larger than themselves.</p>

        <h2>Habitat and Diet</h2>
        <p>Bengal tigers are primarily found in the dense forests and grasslands of India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan, and Myanmar. They prefer areas near water sources like rivers and lakes. As apex predators, Bengal tigers are carnivores, hunting large animals such as deer, wild boar, and even buffalo. They are solitary hunters, using their stealth and strength to ambush prey.</p>

The population of Bengal tigers is threatened by habitat loss, poaching for their fur and body parts, and human-wildlife conflict. Conservation efforts are being made to protect these majestic animals, including anti-poaching laws, wildlife corridors, and habitat restoration projects.</p>
